# Client side OpenSCAD customizer

Derived from https://github.com/ochafik/openscad-wasm and modified to host a predefined model with parameters exposed, rather than an interactive editor.

I am a bit beyond my depth, and my modifications are surely clumsy.  All credit goes to the original, all bugs are mine.

The hope is that it will be serviceable in the near term and it can improve over time.
